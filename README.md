# ETSIINFINDER

## ETSIINFINDER is a discord bot made for DA-ETSIINF's valentines event

When someone joins a server, it saves the roles assigned in the pre-union form and asks for an official upm mail and hobbies.

The mail is asked so no proffesor can join the activity.

For running the bot you need to create a discord server and a .env file to save the following credentials:

> *TOKEN* : Unique token of your discord bot
>
> *MAIL_ID*: Channel id where you want the mail to be sent
>
> *HOBBIES_ID*: Channel id where you want the hobbies to be sent
>
> *ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID*: Channel id only visible for server administrators where every mail sent not ending in @alumnos.upm.es will be notified and studied by moderators
>
> *GUILD_ID*: Guild_id needed when creating the match channel

Whenever this credentials are stored, just exeute bot.py file and bot will start running.
